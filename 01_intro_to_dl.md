### 📌 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

> AI is the field of computer science focused on building systems that can mimic human cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, and perception.
> 
- AI emerged in the 1950s with early concepts like the **Turing Test** and the **Dartmouth Conference**.
- Modern AI spans from simple rule-based systems to highly adaptive learning models.

### 🔁 2. From Traditional Programming to Machine Learning

| Traditional Programming | Machine Learning |
| --- | --- |
| Manually defined rules | Learns patterns from data |
| Predictable, fixed logic | Probabilistic output |
| Requires domain knowledge | Flexible and scalable |
| No learning ability | Improves through experience |

### 🧬 3. The Brain Behind AI – Neural Networks

- **Neurons in the human brain** inspired the concept of artificial neurons (*Perceptrons*).
- A perceptron receives inputs, applies weights, and activates only if a threshold is met.
- This process allows networks of neurons to learn complex patterns from data.

---

### 🔎 4. Deep Neural Networks & AI History

- A **deep neural network (DNN)** has multiple hidden layers, enabling it to learn hierarchical features.
- **Challenges** like the *vanishing gradient problem* were overcome through backpropagation.
- 📈 Landmark: **AlexNet (2012)** significantly outperformed prior models in image recognition tasks (ILSVRC).

### 🤖 5. Applications of AI We Use Every Day

- 🎬 YouTube/Netflix: Content recommendation via DL-based collaborative filtering.
- 🔊 Smart Speakers: Voice recognition powered by NLP.
- 🌐 Translators: Papago, Google Translate, DeepL using LLMs.
- ✍️ ChatGPT: Generative AI based on transformer architecture.

### 🌟 6. Why Learn Deep Learning?

- It underlies modern AI systems like GPT, AlphaGo, DALL·E, etc.
- Applicable in NLP, Vision, Speech, Robotics, and more.
- Understanding DL is essential for AI research and development.

### 💡 My Takeaways

- This session enhanced my understanding of the paradigm shift from rule-based programming to data-driven machine learning approaches.  
- I found the concept of the perceptron, inspired by biological neurons, to be a foundational and intuitively compelling model in neural networks.  
- Moving forward, I plan to investigate convolutional networks, backpropagation mechanisms, and Transformer-based architectures to deepen my understanding of modern deep learning systems.
